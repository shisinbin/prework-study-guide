        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>HTML attributes are defined in the beginning element, never the closing element.</li>
          <li>Section elements are semantic elements that define a section in the document that contains thematic content.</li>
          <li>The id attribute is used as a way to identify elements and select them.</li>

      <section class="card", id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>There are three ways of adding CSS: inline, internal, external. The most common is the latter.</li>
          <li>CSS rules follow a standard pattern/formula: selector, property, value.</li>
          <li>Kinda linked with HTML, but important for CSS: every HTML element is essentially a box, with a margin, a border and padding, and these things can be fiddled with via using CSS.</li>
          <li>Two or more elements (e.g. h1, footer,...) can be shared which is a good way to reduce clutter, encourages reusability.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the CSS rule to a class attribute with a class selector. Boy, that's kinda confusing, but yeah, it's just a way to get things looking a certain way within a sort of section.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git checkout branch-name: switches to branch</li>
          <li>git remote prune origin OR git fetch -p: removes 'stale' branches on the remote/github side of things</li>
          <li>git branch -d branch-name: removes the branch locally</li>
          <li>git branch -r: shows remote (github) branches</li>
          <li>git branch -a: shows both remote and local branches</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>When we connect a JavaScript file to an HTML file, we stick it in the footer element in the body with script tags.</li>
          <li>JavaScript code runs from in a logical, top-down way.</li>
          <li>Being able to store groups of data in an array is a fundamental feature of JavaScript.</li>
          <li>If conditional statements, for loops, and enveloping bits of code in functions before calling them are common procedures/methods found in JavaScript files.</li>
          <li>Using the console.log() method and then using Google Chrome's dev tools and console is a useful way of debugging JavaScript code easily.</li>
