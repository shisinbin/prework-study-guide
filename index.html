        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Something something else about HTML etc etc</li>

      <section class="card", id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>there are three ways of adding CSS: inline, internal, external</li>
          <li>css rules follow a standard pattern/formula: property, value</li>
          <li>kinda linked with HTML, but important for CSS, that every HTML element is essentially a box, with a margin, a border and padding, and these things can be fiddled with with CSS</li>
          <li>two or more elements (e.g. h1, footer,...) can be shared which is a good way to reduce clutter</li>
          <li>class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the CSS rule to a class attribute with a class selector. boy, that's kinda confusing, but yeah, it's just a way to get things looking a certain way within a sort of section.</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git checkout branch-name: switches to branch</li>
          <li>git remote prune origin OR git fetch -p: removes 'stale' branches on the remote/github side of things</li>
          <li>git branch -d branch-name: removes the branch locally</li>
          <li>git branch -r: shows remote (github) branches</li>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>When we connect a js file to a html file, we stick it in the footer element in the body with script tags</li>
          <li>js code runs from top down</li>
          <li>being able to store groups of data in an array is a fundamental feature of js</li>
          <li>if conditional statements, for loops, enveloping bits of code in functions and then calling them are often found in js files</li>
          <li>using the console.log() method and then using chrome's dev tools and console is a useful way of debugging js code easily</li>
