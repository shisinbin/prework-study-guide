# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

A webpage that includes notes about some of the topics covered in the prework section of the bootcamp, namely HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. It is aimed at a bootcamp student who wishes to revise or study noteworthy things about these topics.

In completing this project I learnt about some of the basics that go into building a webpage. In particular, I learnt about the correct procedures and workflow that a web developer should follow in order to produce and deploy a successfully working webpage.
